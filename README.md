This repository contains a simple Tcl script that demonstrates an unexpected behavior when using the expr command with non-numeric arguments. The script defines a procedure foo that takes a single argument x, prints the value of x and x+1 and returns. When the script is executed with a non-numeric argument such as a string, the expr command will not produce an error but will produce an unexpected result. The bug is that the expr command does not perform type checking on the input arguments. This can lead to unexpected results or errors if the arguments are not of the correct type. This bug can be fixed by adding type checking to the expr command. A simple solution is to use the string is integer command to check if the input arguments are integers before evaluating the expression. If the arguments are not integers, the command should return an error.
